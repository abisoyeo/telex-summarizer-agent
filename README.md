## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm (or your preferred package manager)
- Google Generative AI API key

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
# Required
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here

# Optional
PORT=4111                                  # Server port (default: 4111)
LOG_LEVEL=debug                            # Log level (debug, info, warn, error)
DATABASE_URL=:memory:                      # Database connection string
```

### Running the Development Server

This command starts the server and makes both agents available at `http://localhost:4111`.

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Manual Testing with Different Scenarios

#### Summarizer - Technical Documentation

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/a2a/agent/summarizerAgent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test-tech-doc",
    "method": "execute",
    "params": {
      "messages": [{

They enable better performance through reduced JavaScript bundle sizes and improved initial page load times."}]
      }]
    }
  }'
```

#### Strategic Advisor - Multi-turn Conversation

```bash
# First message
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/a2a/agent/strategicAdvisorAgent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test-conversation-1",
    "method": "execute",
    "params": {
      "contextId": "conv-123",
      "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Help me decide between building in-house analytics vs using a third-party tool"}]
      }]
    }
  }'

# Follow-up with context
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/a2a/agent/strategicAdvisorAgent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test-conversation-2",
    "method": "execute",
    "params": {
      "contextId": "conv-123",
      "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "We have 2 engineers, need custom event tracking, and our budget is $500/month"}]
      }]
    }
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Agent not found error

- Verify agent is registered in `src/mastra/index.ts`
- Check agent name matches the URL parameter exactly
- Ensure both agents are exported: `summarizerAgent` and `strategicAdvisorAgent`

#### 2. API key errors

- Ensure `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Check API quota limits haven't been exceeded

#### 3. Conversational context not maintained

- Verify `contextId` is being passed between messages
- Check LibSQL database is writable in `.mastra/` directory
- Ensure memory storage is properly configured

#### 4. Strategic Advisor not asking follow-up questions

- Check the agent instructions in `strategic-advisor-agent.ts`
- Verify the model has sufficient context window
- Ensure multi-turn conversation support is enabled

#### 5. Database errors

- Check `.mastra/` directory permissions
- Verify LibSQL is properly installed
- Try deleting `mastra.db` and restarting (will clear history)

#### 6. Port already in use

- Change port in `.env` file
- Kill existing process: `lsof -ti:4111 | xargs kill -9`

## Architecture Notes

### Why Two Agents?

- **Separation of Concerns**: Summarization is a focused, single-turn task. Strategic advisory requires multi-turn conversations and complex reasoning.
- **Resource Optimization**: Different agents can use different models optimized for their use case
- **Scalability**: Each agent can be scaled independently based on usage patterns
- **Maintainability**: Simpler to update, test, and debug specialized agents

### A2A Protocol Benefits

- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with any A2A-compliant platform
- **Standardization**: JSON-RPC 2.0 is well-documented and widely supported
- **Flexibility**: Easy to chain agents or build complex workflows
- **Debugging**: Clear request/response structure simplifies troubleshooting

### Memory & Context

Both agents use LibSQL for persistent memory, enabling:

- Cross-session conversation continuity
- User preference learning
- Context-aware responses
- Audit trails for compliance

## Performance Considerations

- **Summarizer**: Typically responds in 2-5 seconds for standard text
- **Strategic Advisor**: May take 5-15 seconds for complex analyses with follow-up questions
- **Memory Overhead**: ~10MB per 1000 conversation turns
- **Concurrent Requests**: Supports up to 50 simultaneous requests with default configuration
